# Image-Compression-Using-Vector-Quantization-with-LBG-algorithm
Image Compression is required a lot so that transfer of data, time taken in transferring the data and storage space of data can be reduced.
Vector Quantization is a lossy data compression technique which is going quite popular in compression. Using Vector Quantization in 1980 Linde-Buzo-Gray algorithm was proposed.
This project focuses on the implementation of it using codebook generation by random method.
